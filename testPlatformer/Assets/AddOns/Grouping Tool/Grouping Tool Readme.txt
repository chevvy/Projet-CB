Easily group GameObjects together right in the Unity Hierarchy Panel from the context menu or with a keyboard shortcut (Cmd+G on Mac or Ctrl+G on Windows).

By default objects are grouped into an empty GameObject. 

You can use your own Prefab template for grouping objects. Set the object template in "Window > Grouping Tool > Group Template" . Use context menu or keyboard shortcut to group objects with your custom Prefab Parent template (Cmd+Shift+G on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+G on Windows).
